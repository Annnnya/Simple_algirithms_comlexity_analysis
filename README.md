# Simple_algirithms_comlexity_analysis

These ipynb notebooks feature analysis of time comlexity for some popular known time complexity optimizations for common algorithmic tasks

Here I reviewed usual multiplication and Strassen multiplication, different ways to choose pivots for k-element searc algorithm. The main highlight is snslysis of warious modifications of flajolet-martin algorithm.
The code is focused to create visualisations and plots.
